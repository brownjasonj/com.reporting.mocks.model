/*
    Theta (Î˜) represents the rate of change between the option price and time,
    or time sensitivity - sometimes known as an option's time decay. Theta
    indicates the amount an option's price would decrease as the time to expiration
    decreases, all else equal. For example, assume an investor is long an option
    with a theta of -0.50. The option's price would decrease by 50 cents every day
    that passes, all else being equal.
