/*
    Delta (Î”) represents the rate of change between the option's price
    and a $1 change in the underlying asset's price. In other words, the
    price sensitivity of the option is relative to the underlying asset.
    Delta of a call option has a range between zero and one, while the delta
    of a put option has a range between zero and negative one. For example,
    assume an investor is long a call option with a delta of 0.50. Therefore,
    if the underlying stock increases by $1, the option's price would
    theoretically increase by 50 cents.
