/*
    Gamma (Î“) represents the rate of change between an option's delta
    and the underlying asset's price. This is called second-order
    (second-derivative) price sensitivity. Gamma indicates the amount
    the delta would change given a $1 move in the underlying security.
    For example, assume an investor is long one call option on hypothetical
    stock XYZ. The call option has a delta of 0.50 and a gamma of 0.10. Therefore,
    if stock XYZ increases or decreases by $1, the call option's delta would
    increase or decrease by 0.10.
